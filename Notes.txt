Initializing State objects (S_0)
- should we have State objects for each level
    - one State object per Strategy
        - 
    - one State object per Solution
        - 
    - State object for Firm
        - 

Transition State object (S_t -> S_{t + 1})
- 



Initialize Exog_Info object (W_0)
- simulate exog_info (W_t -> W_{t+1})
- or source new exog_info (W_{t+1})


Strategy class
- make decision based on State
- return contribution
- source or generate exog_info
    - market information
    - performance information?

- transitioning State object
    - inputs are decision, exog_info
    - output is updated State object

- 

Solution class


Firm class
- visualize firm statistics
    - revenue, cost and profit projections
    -
